## Option 1: The "Technical Deep Dive" (Best for Engineering Reach)

**Headline:** Building Production-Grade Agentic AI Systems: From Concept to Kubernetes 🏗️🧠

I recently built and deployed an **Agentic AI Travel Planner** that goes beyond simple LLM wrappers. This system uses autonomous agents to research, plan, and generate hyper-personalized itineraries in sub-second time.

💡 **Why this matters?**
Most GenAI apps fail in production due to hallucination and latency. Here’s how I solved that:

1.  **Inference Speed:** leveraged **Groq’s LPU™** (Llama-3-70b) for lightning-fast reasoning.
2.  **Agentic Workflow:** Built with **LangChain** to orchestrate multi-step reasoning (City Selection -> Interest Mapping -> Itinerary Construction).
3.  **Observability:** Integrated a full **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** pipeline to monitor every prompt, token usage, and latency metric in real-time.
4.  **Scalability:** Containerized with **Docker** and orchestrated locally via **Kubernetes (Minikube)**.

## Option 2: The "Problem Solver" (Best for Recruiters & Business)

**Headline:** 🌍 Planning travel is stressful. So I built an AI Agent to do it for me.

I’m excited to share my latest project: **The Agentic AI Travel Planner**.

Unlike standard chatbots, this application acts as an intelligent travel agent. You simply tell it where you want to go and what you love doing, and it autonomously crafts a detailed, day-by-day itinerary with budget estimates.

**Under the hood, it’s an enterprise-grade system:**
✅ **AI Core:** LangChain + Groq (Llama-3)
✅ **Frontend:** Streamlit (Glassmorphism Design)
✅ **Infra:** Docker & Kubernetes
✅ **Monitoring:** ELK Stack for LLMOps

I focused heavily on **System Design** and **User Experience**, ensuring the app is not just smart, but robust and visually stunning.

Try it out and let me know where your next trip is! ✈️

## Option 3: The "Short & Impactful"

**Headline:** 🚀 Just Deployed: Agentic AI Travel Planner

Built a fully autonomous travel planning system using **LangChain** and **Groq**.
It features a **Kubernetes-orchestrated** backend and full **LLMOps monitoring** via the ELK Stack.

**Tech Stack:**
🔹 AI: Groq (Llama-3-70b), LangChain
🔹 App: Streamlit, Python
🔹 Ops: Docker, K8s, Elasticsearch, Filebeat

It’s open-source and live!
